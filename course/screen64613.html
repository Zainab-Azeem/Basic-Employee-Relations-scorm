Under Part 432, the supervisor has the option of demotion or removal and does not have to defend his or her reasoning for choosing either action. As is noted in Figure C, mitigation to a lesser action by a third party is not possible. So, if you meet the requirements of proving that the employee was unacceptable, even after being given an opportunity to improve, no third party can challenge the reasons for removing instead of demoting the employee. Therefore, the decision is based on the supervisor’s analysis of whether the employee can function acceptably in a lower graded position or not. Some agencies may have policies that require supervisors to explore demotion options before going to removal, but that policy would be an internal policy, not one that governs all federal supervisors.&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, reduction in the agency-selected penalty, known as mitigation, is a possibility in any action taken under Part 752. Therefore, management will need to explain in the proposal and decision notices what factors led the supervisor to believe that the chosen action (suspension, demotion, or removal) was the right one. Most supervisors who have taken any kind of adverse action against an employee have been told about the Douglas factors. This is a reference to a decision by the Merit Systems Protection Board that listed 12 factors that might be taken into consideration when deciding on the appropriate penalty in any adverse action. You should provide the supervisor with a copy of these factors, and assist in its application. The Douglas factors compel a deciding official to examine any issue that might support a more severe penalty, as well as those factors that would convince the deciding official to lower the penalty.</p>
