		<div class="textContent" id="UDUTU_Text1_Content"><p>Federal agency supervisors play an important role in Federal labor relations. They are at the front line of an agency’s efforts to comply with the Statute because they are responsible for properly applying the terms and conditions of their CBA. In effect, they make the day-to-day decisions that impact the working conditions of unionized employees. Front-line supervisors are also in the best position for setting the tone for labor relations in their particular agency. That tone can range from a positive, constructive, and collaborative relationship on one end of the continuum to a tense, adversarial, and combative relationship on the other end. The former is clearly more desirable than the latter.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the great resources that are available to help Federal supervisors become and remain successful in their relationships with their unions is their assigned LR/ELR specialists and/or ER specialist. One of the key takeaways from this course is the critical importance of developing a good relationship with the Labor Relations Specialists. Supervisors should be encouraged to make it a point to consult them for advice and counsel when making decisions or interpreting and applying CBA provisions. The time spent seeking that counsel on the front end of an uncertain situation can save supervisors a lot of time and anxiety. Sound labor relations counsel can significantly mitigate the risk of unfair labor practices (ULP) charges and other employment practice liability for the supervisor and his/her agency on the back end of a decision or action taken.</p><p><br /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
