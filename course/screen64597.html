(continued)</b></p><p>Positive feedback is news or input to an employee about an effort well done. Do not underestimate the power of positive feedback. Sometimes people are quick to point out to someone when a person makes a mistake. Sometimes employers forget to acknowledge employees when they do something right. Giving positive feedback can be a powerful tool for employee motivation.</p><p>Tips to Give to Supervisors for Positive Feedback:</p><ol><li>Do not wait: &nbsp;Positive feedback is too important to let slide. Say something right away.</li><li>Make it public: &nbsp;While negative feedback should be given privately, positive feedback should be given publicly. Do it in front of as large a group as appropriate.</li><li>Be specific: &nbsp;Don't just say "Good job, Mary." &nbsp;Instead say something like "Mary, that new standard of operating procedures handbook you developed has really helped everyone on the team. Thanks for coming up with it and keep up the good work."</li><li>Make a big deal out of it: &nbsp;You don't want to assemble the entire agency every time you give positive feedback, but do as much ceremony as the action warrants.</li><li>Do it often: &nbsp;Don't wait for the big successes. Celebrate the small ones too.</li><li>Be sincere: &nbsp;Don't praise someone for coming in on time. Don't congratulate someone for just doing their job. People will see right through you. Really mean it when you give positive feedback.</li></ol>
