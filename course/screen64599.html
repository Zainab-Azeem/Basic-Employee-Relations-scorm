Most often, that guidance exists only in performance standards that were issued early on. But there may also be applicable operating manuals or guides, so take a look at everything.</li><li>Read the performance standards. If they don’t really describe what you want from the employee, take the time to fix them. If your organization uses generic standards that cannot be modified, think through the specific expectations that you will communicate to the employee to further explain and clarify those standards. Write these notes down.</li><li>If you do have operating manuals, guides, or other tools that all employees use, take a look at them and see how these could be used to help the employee improve. Try to read them as objectively as possible to look for areas that may not be clear. Remember, you know this job (probably better than almost everybody else), but there is some part of the job that is not making sense or becoming clear to this employee. If you have to, break it down into parts and explain it from the bottom up.</li><li>Remember your goal is to improve the employee’s performance, not to win an argument with the employee. Keep track of specific examples of poor performance on work assignments. Doing so will make it easier for you to explain deficiencies in the employee’s performance through the use of examples. Write out and then practice describing what acceptable performance in the job looks like. Seek to clarify with the employee any area that may be unclear, and encourage future good performance.</li></ol>
