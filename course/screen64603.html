For example, an employee may be given a checklist, paired with another employee, offered training, and/or given closer supervision. Not every employee will require every type of assistance, but once assistance is offered, be sure the supervisor follows through with it in the opportunity period.&nbsp;</p><p>The procedures for providing a formal opportunity to improve are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Determination of Unacceptable Performance:</b> Employee’s performance is determined to be unacceptable in one or more critical elements.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Opportunity Period Notice Issued:</b> Inform the employee in writing of the critical element(s) in which he or she is failing, what is needed to bring performance up to an acceptable level, what assistance will be provided, and the consequences of failing to improve during the opportunity period.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Formal Opportunity To Improve:</b> Employee must bring performance up to an acceptable level in failed critical element(s). Duration of opportunity period may vary. Be sure to document the employee’s progress and to provide any appropriate assistance.&nbsp;</li><li><b>Determination of Performance Improvement:</b> Consider the evidence of performance and compare with standards and expectations outlined in the opportunity period notice.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Hopefully, the employee will improve and maintain acceptable performance. However, if an employee fails to perform acceptably by the end of the opportunity period or improves but then fails again in the same critical element within 1 year from the start of the opportunity period, the supervisor may demote or remove the employee without going through another opportunity period.</p><p>Note:&nbsp;In reality, performance-based actions do not always run as smoothly as the procedures just described. Some issues may occur that deserve special consideration.&nbsp;</p>
