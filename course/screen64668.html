Here are a few questions to ask:</p><ul><li>Does the decision produce a change or are you merely reinforcing an existing policy or practice?</li><li>Does the change affect bargaining unit employees?</li><li>Does the change affect conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees?</li><li>Is the change significant, or "de minimis?"</li><li>Is the subject matter of the change already "covered by" the CBA?</li></ul><p>The first bullet asks whether or not the Agency is introducing something new, or merely reinforcing an existing policy or practice. In the latter case, there is no need for notice to the union. However, a failure to provide a return to compliance notice might negatively impact efforts to enforce the desired changes in working conditions. The second bullet asks whether or not the change even relates to the bargaining unit. The third bullet asks whether or not the change affects the conditions of employment of bargaining unit employees. For example, if the change dealt with a matter that was specifically required by a Federal statute (such as a health insurance or a classification matter), then such matters are defined out from being conditions of employment. The last two bullets deal with exceptions to the requirement that a change in conditions of employment must be negotiated with the union. If the change is insignificant, or minimal, then, normally, FLRA case law provides that it does not have to be negotiated with the labor union. Likewise, if the change involves a matter that is already "covered by" the existing CBA, then, normally, it does not have to be negotiated with the union. The last two bullets are merely to introduce the concepts; however, in-depth discussion on these points is beyond this module. Supervisors should be advised that it is best practice to consult the Labor Relations Specialist if they believe a change is insignificant or "covered by" the CBA.</p><p>The next section of this lesson provides more in-depth information about meetings or discussions with bargaining unit members and their representatives, including investigatory interviews.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
