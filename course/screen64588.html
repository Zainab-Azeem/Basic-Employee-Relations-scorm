		<div class="textContent" id="UDUTU_Text1_Content"><p>There is no explicit authority for granting nonmonetary awards. However, 5 U.S.C. 4503 states that the head of an agency may "incur necessary expense for the honorary recognition" of an employee. Based on this statement, 5 C.F.R. 451.104(a) states that an agency may grant "a cash, honorary, or informal recognition award, or grant time off" to employees, on several bases. In addition, 5 C.F.R. 451.102 defines an award as "something bestowed or an action taken".<br><br></p><p>Honorary awards are a big deal and they should be. Often, such honor awards do not use monetary recognition at all. These awards usually take the form of items such as certificates, plaques, or medals. They are often presented by the Department Head or another high ranking official in a formal, public ceremony and convey the message that the person receiving the award is exceptional and deserving of high honor and public recognition. Those acts and expressions are awards in themselves, and they are among the most powerful noncash awards the agency can grant. Publicly identifying individuals and groups who embody the organization's core values is the key to their serving as examples for and inspiring others. All Federal civilian employees who meet the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. 2105, either as an individual or member of a group are eligible to receive an honorary award.<br><br></p><p>Honorary awards are granted to an employee, as an individual or member of a group, to recognize significant, exceptional contribution, suggestion, invention, or special act or service connected with official employment that contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations in the public interest. They are often given to recognize exceptional service and contributions over an extended period of time, such as a long and noteworthy career.</p></div>
