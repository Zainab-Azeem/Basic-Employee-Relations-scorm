		<section style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6; margin: 20px; padding: 15px; border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
  
  <p><strong>18.2.1 Nature of Travelling Allowance:</strong> Travelling Allowance is granted to an employee to cover the expenses which he/she incurs in travelling in the interest of the Organization.</p>

  <p><strong>18.2.2 Approval of Payment:</strong> No TA bill shall be paid unless it is duly processed and checked for correctness and passed by the Competent Authority.</p>

  <p><strong>18.2.3 Checking of TA Bills:</strong> Before presenting a bill to the Competent Authority for signing or countersigning, the Controlling Officer as designated by the Competent Authority shall:</p>

  <ul style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: disc;">
    <li>Process and scrutinize the TA Bill(s) and travelling allowance(s).</li>
    <li>Scrutinize carefully the distance entered in travelling allowance bills and maintain a proper check register of bills signed or countersigned by him, ensuring that a double payment for one and the same journey is not passed.</li>
    <li>Exercise care that there is no evasion or breach of the fundamental principle of travelling allowance, as allowance is not to be made a source of profit.</li>
    <li>Observe any subsidiary rules or orders which a Competent Authority may take for guidance.</li>
    <li>Satisfy himself that the mileage allowance for journey by a bus, railway, or other public conveyance has been claimed at the rate applicable to the class of accommodation actually used.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>18.2.4 Journey for which TA is Permissible:</strong> Travelling Allowance may be drawn in respect of a journey performed for any of the following purposes:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>For the purpose of tour.</li>
    <li>On transfer.</li>
    <li>To give evidence in a court or to attend an inquiry or conference in relation to the business of the Organization. <em>Double TA shall not be allowed.</em></li>
    <li>Any other purpose authorized by the Competent Authority.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>18.2.5 Calculation of Mileage for the Purpose of TA:</strong> A mileage allowance is an allowance calculated on the distance travelled, which is given to meet the cost of a particular journey and is governed by the following principles:</p>
  <ul style="margin-left: 30px; list-style-type: decimal;">
    <li>For the purpose of calculating mileage allowance, a journey between two places shall be deemed to have been performed by the shortest of two or more practicable routes, or by the cheapest of such routes as may be equally short.</li>
    <li>The shortest route is that by which the traveler can most speedily reach his destination by the ordinary modes of travelling. In case of doubt, the Competent Authority may decide which shall be regarded as the shortest/cheapest of two or more routes.</li>
    <li>If an employee travels by a route which is not the shortest but is cheaper than the shortest, his mileage allowance should be calculated on that route.</li>
  </ul>
