However, if an employee is still working at an unacceptable level in one or more critical elements, the supervisor will need to give the employee a formal opportunity to improve his or her performance.</p><p>Over the years, agencies have developed different mechanisms for providing employees with a formal opportunity to improve unacceptable performance. Many agencies have adopted the use of the Performance Improvement Plan, often referred to as a "PIP." &nbsp;In this course, we will use the term "opportunity period" as a generic reference to a formal period for improving unacceptable performance.</p><p>This period is designed to give the employee an opportunity to bring his or her performance up to an acceptable level. It is also the supervisor’s opportunity to clearly express his or her expectations and the consequences of not meeting those expectations. If the employee fails to improve to an acceptable level by the end of the opportunity period, further action is warranted.&nbsp;</p><p>Under the current regulations for performance appraisal (5 CFR Part 430), there are three types of performance elements: critical, non-critical, and additional. But remember, you can only remove or demote an employee for unacceptable performance in a critical element.</p>
