		<div class="textContent" id="UDUTU_Text1_Content"><p>Time off awards are allowed by Title 5 U.S.C. 4502(e). When an employee receives a time-off award, they receive time off without charge to leave or loss of pay to encourage and reward superior accomplishments that contribute to the quality, efficiency, or economy of Government operations. There are no Governmentwide limits on the amount of time off an employee may receive in law or regulation. However, agencies are free to establish their own guidelines and limitations on how much time off is appropriate for various employee contributions, as well as overall periodic limits. The only restriction present in Title 5 CFR 451.104(f) states that time-off awards cannot be converted to cash under any circumstances. All Federal civilian employees who meet the definition of “employee” in 5 U.S.C. 2105, either as an individual or member of a group are eligible to receive a time-off award.&nbsp;</p><p>Individuals or members of groups may receive a time-off award for a suggestion, invention, or special act or service connected with official employment that contributes to the efficiency, economy, or other improvement of Government operations in the public interest. Only individual employees may receive time off without charge to leave for superior accomplishment as reflected in a rating of record. However, this continues to be a time off award. If time off is granted, the award must be processed as a time off award not a rating-based (i.e., performance) award.</p></div>
