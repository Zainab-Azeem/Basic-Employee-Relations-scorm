		<div class="textContent" id="UDUTU_Text1_Content"><p>Informal recognition items are used to recognize contributions of lesser scope that might otherwise go unrecognized. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management has used its regulatory authority to provide for this informal kind of recognition (see section 451.104(a) of title 5, Code of Federal Regulations) as an appropriate agency use of the statutory authority to "incur necessary expense for honorary recognition."</p><p>Informal recognition awards are used to recognize federal civilian employees who meet the definition of "employee" in 5 U.S.C. 2105, either as an individual or member of a group. Employees are eligible to receive informal recognition awards for contributions that otherwise might not merit traditional cash, time-off, or honorary awards. This type of award typically has more informal approval procedures and presentation settings than honorary awards. Items used for recognition are inexpensive off-the-shelf items such as pre-printed pins, balloons, or mugs. However, an employee's contribution still must be clearly acknowledged as part of the presentation.</p></div>
