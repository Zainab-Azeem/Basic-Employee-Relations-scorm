		<div class="textContent" id="UDUTU_Text1_Content"><p><b>A Supervisor’s Authority (continued)</b></p><p>In reviewing the comparison document for Parts 432 and 752, you can see there are distinct differences between these regulations. For example, Part 432 requires that the supervisor give the employee an opportunity to bring his or her performance up to an acceptable level, while Part 752 does not require such an opportunity period. With this difference in mind, you may question the reasoning behind providing some sort of opportunity period if it is not required. Keep in mind that third parties (for example, arbitrators, judges) place a strong emphasis on a supervisor’s effort to assist the employee in improving his or her performance. An opportunity period addresses both of these concerns. While an opportunity period may not be required under Part 752, providing such an opportunity may assist the agency in developing a stronger case before a third party, depending on the type of situation being addressed.</p><p>Another difference between the regulations is that Part 432 requires the use of established performance elements and standards. Under Part 752 employee can be held to ad hoc standards such as explicit instructions or work assignments or professional standards established for certain occupations such as physicians. In some cases, it may be more appropriate to hold employee to these ad hoc standards, as long as they are no more stringent than the established performance standards. As always, check your internal agency policies regarding the use of a formal opportunity period.</p>
