		<div class="textContent" id="UDUTU_Text1_Content"><p><br /></p><p>This Weingarten right is specific to bargaining unit employees. &nbsp;An individual must be a bargaining unit employee at the time of the interview to be entitled to a representative under Weingarten. On the other hand, an employee who was a bargaining unit employee during the events being discussed in the interview who has moved to a non-bargaining unit position by the time the interview takes place would not be covered by the Weingarten right. &nbsp;An employee’s request does not have to be in specific form, but it must be enough to let management know the employee wants representation. &nbsp;For example, the FLRA held that when an employee stated that he would like to speak with a lawyer or somebody to advise him or explain what was happening, that was a request for representation.</p><p>If an employee makes a request for representation, the agency representative must: &nbsp;stop the interview and allow the individual to obtain a union representative before proceeding with the interview; deny the request and end the interview immediately; or give the employee a choice of having the interview without representation or ending the interview. It is not necessary to verbally advise the employee of Weingarten rights ahead of time, or during the investigatory interview (unless required by the CBA). &nbsp;The Statute provides for an annual notice of these rights. &nbsp;The Weingarten right applies to all examinations conducted by a representative of the agency, where the employee reasonably believes that the examination may result in disciplinary action against the employee. This may include criminal investigations when they are conducted by an agency representative and the other criteria are met.</p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><font color="#b01c05">Select Next to continue.</font></strong></p></div>
